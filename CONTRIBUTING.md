# General information

For specific proposals, please provide them as pull requests or issues via our GitHub site. 
For general discussion, feel free to use the cii-badges mailing list.

Pull requests and different branches recommended.
Pull requests are preferred, since they are specific. 
For more about how to create a pull request, see https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/.

We recommend creating different branches for different (logical) changes, and creating a pull request when you're done into the master branch. 
See the GitHub documentation on creating branches and using pull requests.
